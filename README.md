## About

This repository contains the translation files for [Bedocker](https://bedocker.com), the only hosting service custom-built for Minecraft Bedrock. Our goal is to make the website available in as many languages as possible and we rely on contributors for this task.

## Contributing

If you want to help contribute to an existing language, go to the folder of your language and modify the JSON file(s) inside of it. Open a pull request once you're done and we'll take a look, approve it & push it to the website.

If your language doesn't exist yet, please [open an issue](https://github.com/studesh/i18n/issues/new) and we will guide you through the steps once your language is approved.
